Learned:
1)Adding functions to keyboard.
2)Exercised logic thinking, was hard to implement the "operationMode" and "clearScreen" solutions. I'am pretty sure that are better solutions out there, but got those on my own.
4)Styling CSS box and positioning elements on grid display.
5)Installing custom fonts not from googlefonts.
